# elasticTerraForm

JMF Feb 2019

```
Search and monitor.

You will have to create a Terraform module that deploys (preferably on AWS) and manages an ElasticSearch (ES) cluster.

The ES cluster should be easily monitored and alerting should be possible.

Everything should be documented thoroughly.

Bonuses:
  - Easy way to display the data
  - Any other bonuses are welcome!```

What we expect now
`You will build a minimal Terraform module to deploy a single node ES in an AWS environment`

Let me know when you are finished & send me a link to the source for review!
